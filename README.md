This is a python file that runs with a graphical user interace.  You paste text and so forth into the first text window, and you can convert to a string to be used in a computer program.  The string formatting works with python.  If you're programming language uses strings that are formatted like Python, it should work.  In addition to adding the \n for newlines, \t for tabs and so forth, it replaced the " with \\" and the ' with \\' which you must do in order to use the string inside of quotations while coding.  It will also write the string to the command line if you want to grab the output there.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions or if it you have problems with it.  I have a similar program that writes the contents to a file.  If you want me to publish, let me know.  You can easily paste this into any text editor and save though.
